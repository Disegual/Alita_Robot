Alita is a Telegram Group managment bot made using **[Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) _async version_** and **[Python](https://python.org)**, which makes it modern and faster than most of the exisitng Telegram Chat Managers.

**Alita's features over other bots:**
- Modern
- Fast
- Fully asynchronous
- Fully open-source

Can be found on Telegram as [@Alita_Robot](https://t.me/Alita_Robot).

Alita is currently available in 6 Languages as of now:
- **en-US**
- **pt-BR**

- **ru-RU**

More languages can be managed in the _locales_ folder.

We are still working on adding new languages.
